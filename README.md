# Marine_Drive-_Scene
🌉 Marine Drive – A vibrant OpenGL C++ animation with a moving bus, cars, river waves, jungle, birds, sun-to-moon transitions, and scenic day to night scenes.


This is a dynamic and colorful animated scene built using **OpenGL with C++**, inspired by a scenic "Marine Drive" view. The project demonstrates natural transitions through **day**, **sunset**, and **night** using graphical elements like vehicles, rivers, forests, and celestial changes. It’s a great showcase of animation techniques and scene transitions using basic OpenGL concepts.
🕹️ Users can interact with the scene using keyboard input — pressing specific keys switches between the daytime, sunset, and night views, allowing manual control of the sun, moon, and sky environment.
